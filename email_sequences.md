SUBJECT: Thinking about YouTube shorts for [Channel Name]?

---

Hello there!

Been watching your [channel niche] content for a while. We recently got to thinking, your long-form stuff has so many moments that would work perfectly as Shorts, but it looks like you haven't really leaned into them consistently.

We'd love to make you a pack of 5 Shorts from your existing videos, completely on us. Just reply to this email or shoot me a text at 484-889-1131 and we'll get started.

Either way, keep making great stuff.

Warmest Regards,
Zack

PERSONALIZATION NOTES:
• [Channel Name]: their YouTube channel name exactly as it appears

WHY THIS WORKS:
• The subject line with their channel name makes it impossible to ignore. It's clearly personal, not mass-sent. Opens with genuine fan energy. Zero links keeps it clean and out of spam.

DELIVERABILITY NOTES:
• Word count: 90
• Links: 0
• Spam trigger words: None

SUBJECT: [channel niche] creators on shorts right now

---

Hello there!

Quick thought I wanted to share.

Creators in [their niche] with a similar sub count to yours are pulling 50K-200K views per Short, even when their long-form averages way less. The algorithm treats Shorts as a completely separate discovery channel.

Most of your catalog would translate really well. You're sitting on a lot of untapped reach.

The offer still stands. We'll make you 5 Shorts from your best clips at no cost. Just reply or text me at 484-889-1131.

Warmest Regards,
Zack

PERSONALIZATION NOTES:
• [their niche]: "film commentary," "retro gaming," "personal finance," etc.
• [channel niche]: shorter version for subject line (e.g., "horror film" or "gaming")
• Adjust the 50K-200K range to match real Shorts performance data in their niche

WHY THIS WORKS:
• Shares a real data point that reframes Shorts as a growth lever, not extra work. References their existing catalog as the asset. The CTA is a gentle reminder, not a new pitch.

SUBJECT: how [similar creator] added 40k subs in 3 months

---

Hello there!

One of the [their niche] creators we work with had a similar setup to yours. Strong long-form library, solid engagement, zero Shorts. Within 3 months of posting repurposed clips, they added 40K subscribers and their long-form views actually went up too.

They didn't change anything about how they make videos. We just gave their existing content a second life.

If you want to see what that looks like for your channel, just reply or text me at 484-889-1131. The pack of 5 is still yours.

Warmest Regards,
Zack

PERSONALIZATION NOTES:
• [similar creator]: use a real client name if you have permission, otherwise anonymize by niche and size ("a retro gaming channel with 90K subs")
• [their niche]: match to the recipient's content area
• Adjust the numbers (40K subs, 3 months) to match your actual results. Never fabricate.

WHY THIS WORKS:
• Social proof through a relatable story. Same setup, same niche, real results. "They didn't change anything" removes the objection that Shorts require new effort. The CTA feels like a natural next step, not a hard sell.

EMAIL 4 of 5: The Proof
Send: Day 11 of sequence

SUBJECT: quick question about [Channel Name]

---

Hello there!

Last thing on this. I looked at your channel more closely.

You have [longform_count] videos, most over [avg_duration] minutes long. That's roughly [estimated_clips] potential Shorts sitting in your content right now. Based on what we see in [their niche], those could realistically pull [estimated monthly views] views per month combined.

We handle everything. Clipping, editing, captions, posting schedule. You don't touch anything.

Worth a look, or bad timing? Reply here or text me at 484-889-1131.

Warmest Regards,
Zack

PERSONALIZATION NOTES:
• [longform_count]: from your scraper data
• [avg_duration]: from avg_duration_seconds, converted to minutes
• [estimated_clips]: longform_count * 2-3 (conservative estimate)
• [estimated monthly views]: use comparable channels' Shorts performance as a benchmark
• [their niche]: "film commentary," "gaming," etc.

WHY THIS WORKS:
• Gets specific with THEIR numbers. This can't be a mass email if it references their exact video count and durations. The binary CTA ("worth a look, or bad timing?") makes replying easy even if the answer is no, and "bad timing" replies often convert later.

SUBJECT: last thing on [Channel Name]

Hello there!

Completely understand if the timing isn't right or this isn't on your radar.

I'll stop filling up your inbox after this one. But if you ever want those 5 Shorts made from your content, just reply or text me at 484-889-1131. The offer stays open.

I genuinely enjoy your stuff either way. Keep it up.

Warmest Regards,
Zack

PERSONALIZATION NOTES:
• No heavy personalization needed. The simplicity is the point.
• "I genuinely enjoy your stuff" reinforces the fan angle from email 1.

WHY THIS WORKS:
• The breakup email consistently gets the highest reply rate in cold sequences. Short, honest, zero pressure. "The link stays open" removes urgency while keeping the door open. Many creators come back weeks or months later when they're ready.

DELIVERABILITY NOTES:
• Word count: 60

# Sequence Strategy Brief

## 1. Timing and Cadence

| Email | Day | Gap | Why this gap |
|-------|-----|-----|-------------|
| 1 | Day 1 | N/A | Lead with the fan angle while intent is fresh |
| 2 | Day 3 | 2 days | Quick follow-up while they remember the first email |
| 3 | Day 7 | 4 days | Give them breathing room before the social proof |
| 4 | Day 11 | 4 days | Enough time to not feel aggressive |
| 5 | Day 16 | 5 days | Longer gap makes the breakup feel genuine |

Best send times: Tuesday-Thursday, 9-11 AM in the recipient's local timezone. Avoid Mondays (inbox overload) and Fridays (mentally checked out).

## 2. Subject Line A/B Variants

| Email | Primary | Variant A | Variant B |
|-------|---------|-----------|-----------|
| 1 | Thinking about YouTube shorts for [Channel Name]? | shorts idea for [Channel Name]? | [Channel Name] as shorts? |
| 2 | shorts potential for [Channel Name]? | [Channel Name] shorts data? | quick thought about [Channel Name]? |
| 3 | what shorts could do for [Channel Name]? | a shorts story similar to [Channel Name]? | 40k subs from existing videos? |
| 4 | ran some numbers on [Channel Name]? | [Channel Name] has [X] clips waiting? | looked at [Channel Name] closer? |
| 5 | last note about [Channel Name] shorts? | closing the loop on [Channel Name]? | totally fine if not? |

## 3. Reply Handling Guidance

**Positive reply ("Sure, let's chat" / "Tell me more" / texts your number):**
- Reply within 2 hours if possible, same day at latest
- Send a Calendly or specific time options (2-3 slots)
- Keep it short: "Awesome, glad you're interested. Here are a few times that work this week: [times]. Pick whatever's easiest."

**Objection reply ("Too expensive" / "Not sure about quality" / "I do my own shorts"):**
- Acknowledge their concern directly. Don't deflect
- "Totally fair. The 5 we make for you are yours to keep and post regardless. That way you can judge the quality before committing to anything."
- If they do their own shorts: "That's great, not many in your niche do. If you ever want to scale the volume without the time investment, I'm around."

**"Not interested" / "Remove me":**
- Reply immediately: "Got it, appreciate you letting me know. Removing you now. Best of luck with the channel."
- Mark as "rejected" in your database. Never email again.

**No reply after sequence:**
- Wait 30-60 days, then consider a "reframe" email with a completely new angle (e.g., a new feature, a new case study, a trend in their niche). One email only, not a new sequence.

## 4. Personalization Playbook

| Data point | Where to find it |
|---|---|
| First name | Channel "About" page, or their social media bios |
| Recent video title | Their YouTube channel (use one from the last 2 weeks) |
| Niche | Your scraper's `primary_niche` field |
| Subscriber count | Your scraper's `subscriber_count` field |
| Long-form count | Your scraper's `longform_count` field |
| Avg duration | Your scraper's `avg_duration_seconds` field |
| Contact email | Your scraper's `contact_email` field |
| Social links | Channel "About" page (look for Instagram, Twitter) |
| Content style | Watch 2-3 minutes of their most popular video to understand their tone, then reference something specific in email 1 |

## 5. Sending Best Practices

**Domain warming (if using a new domain):**
- Week 1: Send 5-10 emails/day to people you know (colleagues, friends) who will open and reply
- Week 2: 15-20 emails/day, mix of warm and cold
- Week 3: 25-30/day
- Week 4+: Up to 40-50/day max

**Technical setup:**
- Set up SPF, DKIM, and DMARC records for your sending domain
- Use a subdomain for cold outreach (e.g., outreach.auto-phil.com) to protect your main domain reputation
- Never send more than 50 cold emails per mailbox per day
- Spread sends throughout the day (not all at once)

**Daily volume from scraper context:**
- Your scraper finds 5-40 qualified channels per run
- At that volume, one Gmail account is sufficient
- If you scale beyond 50/day, add a second sending account

## 6. Metrics to Track

| Metric | Good benchmark | Great benchmark |
|---|---|---|
| Open rate | 50-60% | 70%+ |
| Reply rate (any reply) | 5-10% | 15%+ |
| Positive reply rate | 2-5% | 8%+ |
| Text message rate | 1-3% | 5%+ |
| Bounce rate | Under 3% | Under 1% |
| Spam complaint rate | Under 0.1% | 0% |

Note: Track replies and text messages as your key conversion metrics. Creators who reply or text are high-intent. Prioritize their Shorts production and follow up quickly (within 24 hours).
